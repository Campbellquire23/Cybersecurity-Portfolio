✅ GitHub Summary (Day 90)

Day 90 Overall – SY0-701 FreeBrainDumps Practice Exam (Day 5)
Completed questions 70–80 of the FreeBrainDumps Security+ SY0-701 practice exam. This session emphasized privileged access management, access control enforcement, digital signing, monitoring/detection mechanisms, and operational risk management.

🔎 Topics Reviewed
🔐 Privileged Access & Identity Security

Privileged Access Management (PAM)

Secures high-level accounts (admins, consultants, domain accounts)

Includes password rotation, session monitoring, JIT access, credential vaulting

Helps mitigate “living off the land” techniques

Data Owner Responsibilities

Identifies risks

Determines appropriate access levels

Ensures data protection policies are enforced

🌐 Access Control & User Accountability

Captive Portals

Require users to accept terms (AUP) before access

Provides legal acknowledgment and liability mitigation

Enforces authentication and access control

Access Control Measures

Prevent unauthorized access

Address liability and misuse concerns

👁 Monitoring & Detection

Cameras, sensors, and lighting

Used as deterrent and detection mechanisms

Load balancers

Ensure availability and accessibility during peak usage

🔏 Software Integrity & Cryptography

Code Signing

Uses developer’s private key to create digital signature

Generates cryptographic hash

Allows users to verify authenticity and integrity

⚠ Risk & Lifecycle Management

Running unsupported or end-of-life applications

Major risk due to lack of security patches

Failure to apply security updates

Increases exposure to known vulnerabilities

📌 Key Reinforcement Areas

PAM implementation strategies

AUP and legal acknowledgment controls

Code signing process and integrity validation

Infrastructure availability planning

Risk of unpatched and EOL systems
