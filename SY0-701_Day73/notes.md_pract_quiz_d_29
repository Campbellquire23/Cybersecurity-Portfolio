Day 73
Overview

Today focused heavily on governance, risk management, cryptography, certificates, physical security controls, and vulnerability lifecycle processes. Emphasis was placed on understanding organizational security responsibilities, operational safeguards, and technical implementations used to protect infrastructure and sensitive data.

Despite challenging quiz performance, substantial progress was made in reinforcing foundational cybersecurity concepts and improving analytical recognition of exam topics.

Key Concepts Reviewed
Risk Management & Security Governance

Risk Appetite defines the amount of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of strategic objectives.

Security awareness programs must align with:

Organizational threat landscape

Industry-specific risks

Training cadence and duration

Regular training helps prevent employee fatigue while maintaining security awareness.

Cloud Security Responsibilities

The Responsibility Matrix (Shared Responsibility Model) clarifies security duties between:

Cloud Service Provider (CSP)

Customer organization

Each party must implement appropriate controls to ensure full protection.

High Availability (HA)

Designed to maintain operations and reduce downtime.

Critical considerations include:

✅ Rapid recovery mechanisms
✅ Redundant infrastructure
✅ Failover systems
✅ Backup integrations

⚠️ However, HA can increase the attack surface if additional components are not properly secured.

Vulnerability Management Lifecycle

After remediation:

Rescan the environment

Validate fixes

Confirm no new vulnerabilities were introduced

Ensure compliance requirements are met

Lifecycle process:

Scan → Remediate → Rescan

This continuous loop strengthens the organization’s security posture.

Data Sanitization

Sanitization permanently removes data from storage devices so it cannot be recovered after decommissioning or recycling hardware.

This is critical for preventing data leakage.

Certificate Security

Revoked certificates are listed in a Certificate Revocation List (CRL).

Systems must check CRLs to ensure certificates are still valid.

Failure to verify revocation status creates major trust vulnerabilities.

Security Control Types

Managerial Controls

Focus on policies, risk strategy, and governance.

Operational Controls

Address day-to-day procedures that maintain security.

Technical Controls

Logical protections such as:

IDS/IPS

Encryption

Access controls

Digital signatures

Digital signatures also support non-repudiation, ensuring senders cannot deny transmitting a message.

Physical Security Sensors

Sensors detect environmental changes such as:

Motion

Temperature

Pressure

Vibration

Detection technologies include:

Ultrasonic

Microwave

Thermal

These devices act as early warning systems.

Wildcard Certificates

A wildcard certificate secures a primary domain and all associated subdomains.

Example:

*.company.com


Provides scalable certificate management.

Public Key Infrastructure & Blockchain

Blockchain functions as a decentralized digital ledger.

Uses public ledgers to provide:

Transparency

Integrity

Tamper resistance

Supports secure transaction records.

Performance Reflection

Quiz scores remained challenging today, but deep note-taking indicates strong conceptual engagement — a far more reliable predictor of long-term certification success than short-term scores.

Consistency remains the primary driver of mastery.
