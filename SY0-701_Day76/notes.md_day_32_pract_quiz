## Day 76 – CompTIA Security+ Practice Quizzes  
**Overall Day:** 76  
**Practice Quiz Day:** 32  
**Domain Focus:** Program Management & Oversight  

Today focused on governance, risk, compliance, and security oversight concepts critical to organizational security strategy and decision-making. Emphasis was placed on understanding how risk is identified, assessed, managed, and monitored at an enterprise level rather than through technical controls alone.

### Key Concepts Covered

- **Risk Assessments**
  - Ad hoc risk assessments are typically performed in response to a major incident.
  - Risk assessments identify threats, likelihood, and impact to calculate overall risk.
  - Risk = Probability × Impact.
  - Qualitative risk assessments rely on experience and judgment.
  - Quantitative risk assessments use numerical values and statistical data.

- **Risk Appetite**
  - Conservative risk appetite avoids risk where possible.
  - Aggressive risk appetite accepts higher risk for potential gain.
  - Neutral risk appetite balances risk and reward.

- **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)**
  - Metrics used to monitor risk exposure and security posture.
  - Examples include failed login attempts, data breaches, or access anomalies.
  - KRIs help measure the effectiveness of security controls over time.

- **Program Management & Governance**
  - Committees provide oversight for specific processes such as change management.
  - Governance focuses on aligning security programs with business objectives.
  - Industry regulations (e.g., PCI DSS) define security requirements for specific sectors.

- **Vendor & Third-Party Risk**
  - Vendor assessments evaluate third-party risk exposure.
  - Due diligence requires thorough evaluation of vendors before onboarding.

### Key Takeaway
This domain emphasizes strategic decision-making, accountability, and long-term risk management rather than hands-on technical controls. Understanding *why* decisions are made is just as important as knowing *how* controls are implemented.
