Day 94 Overall – SY0-701 FreeBrainDumps Practice Exam (Day 9)
Completed questions 110–120 with detailed notes, mistake review, and in-depth conceptual reinforcement. Today’s focus centered on reconnaissance methods, organizational risk management foundations, secure network protocols, vulnerability management workflow, and cloud escape risks.

🔎 Topics Reviewed
🕵️ Reconnaissance & Threat Actors

OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)

Passive reconnaissance method

Gathers publicly available information (websites, public records, social media)

Does not directly interact with target systems

Organized Crime Groups

Primarily financially motivated

Often leverage ransomware and extortion-based attacks

🛠 Operational Security & Maintenance

Maintenance Windows

Scheduled time periods for system updates, patches, or changes

Reduce operational disruption

Can cause temporary service downtime

Network Outages

Occur when services are unavailable

Directly impact users and operations

🔐 Secure Communication Protocols

IPsec

Suite of protocols providing authentication and encryption at the network layer

Secures IP packets

Ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity

Used in VPNs and private cloud communication

🏢 Governance & Risk Management

Policies & Procedures

Foundation of an organization’s risk management program

Define framework for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risk

Internal Audits

Should review policies and procedures first

Validate compliance with risk management framework

🧪 Vulnerability Management

Reporting

Communicates findings to stakeholders

Documents discovered vulnerabilities

Prioritization

Ranks vulnerabilities by severity, exploitability, and impact

Ensures most critical risks are addressed first

☁️ Cloud Security Risks

VM Escape

Critical cloud vulnerability

Occurs when an attacker breaks out of a virtual machine

Gains access to host system or other VMs

Represents significant infrastructure-wide risk

📌 Reinforced Concepts

Passive vs active reconnaissance

Financial motivations of cybercriminal groups

Network-layer encryption (IPsec)

Risk management structure (policy → procedure → audit)

Vulnerability lifecycle (identify → report → prioritize → remediate)

Virtualization security boundaries
