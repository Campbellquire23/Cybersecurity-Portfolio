📘 Day 69 Summary – Practice Quiz Review & Security Concepts

Focus: Continued practice quizzes with deep-dive notes on application security, network defense, cryptography, and secure development practices. Still scoring ~50%, but building strong conceptual foundations through detailed review.

Key Topics Covered

1. Dynamic Analysis

Security testing method that evaluates an application while it is actively running.

Observes real-time behavior and interactions with other systems.

Useful for identifying runtime vulnerabilities not visible in source code.

2. File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)

Continuously monitors and checks critical files for unauthorized changes.

Compares current state to a known baseline to detect tampering.

Key for compliance and detecting insider threats or malware activity.

3. IDS vs. IPS Placement

If IDS detects SQL injection and the firewall isn’t blocking it effectively:

Best action is to deploy IPS mode and position it inline in front of the firewall.

IPS can actively block malicious traffic instead of just alerting.

4. Social Engineering (BEC Example)

Business Email Compromise (BEC) example:

Attacker impersonates the CFO to pressure an employee into sending funds or credentials.

Relies on urgency, authority, and deception.

5. Non-Repudiation

Ensures message senders cannot deny having sent a message.

Uses digital signatures and asymmetric cryptography.

Provides proof of message origin and integrity.

6. Rainbow Table Attacks

Precomputed hash tables used to crack stolen password hashes quickly.

Defense: Salting

Adds a unique random value to each password before hashing.

Makes rainbow tables ineffective.

7. Peer Review & Code Approval

Process where multiple developers examine code before merging.

Prevents malicious code insertion and logic flaws.

Adds accountability and oversight.

Acts as a human-layer defense against insider threats.
