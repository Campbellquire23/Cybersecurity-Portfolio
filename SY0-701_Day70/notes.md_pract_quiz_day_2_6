GitHub Summary – Day 70 (Overall) | Day 26 of Practice Quizzes

Focus: Security operations, monitoring, access controls, governance, cryptography weaknesses, and resilience planning
Activity: Continued practice quizzes with detailed concept review and error analysis

Key Concepts Reviewed

1. SIEM & Threat Detection

SIEM: Collects, correlates, and analyzes security logs/events from multiple sources to detect threats and generate alerts.

Threat hunting: Proactive process of searching for malicious activity that automated tools may miss.

2. Patch Management & Vulnerability Exposure

Patch availability directly affects how long known vulnerabilities remain exploitable.

When patches aren’t available, systems remain exposed and require compensating controls.

3. Secure Web Gateway (SWG)

Filters web traffic to block malware and enforce compliance policies.

Protects remote users without requiring VPN access.

4. Due Diligence & Compliance

Ongoing process of identifying regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.).

Ensures organizational practices align with applicable legal and industry standards.

5. Accounting (AAA Context)

Tracks user activity, logins, commands, and resource usage.

Supports auditing, compliance, and detection of suspicious behavior.

6. Bastion Host

Hardened server used as a controlled entry point into internal systems.

Funnels all administrative access through a single secured gateway.

7. Retention Policies

Define how long different types of data must be stored.

Supports legal, regulatory, and business continuity requirements.

8. Disaster Recovery Infrastructure

Hot sites: Fully operational backups that can immediately assume business operations after a disaster.

9. Cryptographic Weaknesses

MD5: Considered insecure due to collision vulnerabilities.

Cryptographic vulnerabilities: Weaknesses in algorithms or implementations that compromise integrity and security.
