Day 93 Overall – SY0-701 FreeBrainDumps Practice Exam (Day 8)
Completed questions 100–110 of the FreeBrainDumps Security+ SY0-701 practice exam. Today’s session focused heavily on governance controls, identity management, application security, failover testing, encryption standards, and vendor risk evaluation.

🔎 Topics Reviewed
🏢 Vendor & Risk Management

SOC 2 Reports

Used during third-party due diligence

Verify vendor security controls before contracting

Data Masking

Conceals sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) in databases

🌐 Web & Application Security

WAF (Web Application Firewall)

Operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer)

Inspects HTTP/S traffic

Protects against SQL injection, XSS, and other web-based attacks

Branch Protection Requirements

Enforce rules in version control systems

Critical in the SDLC to maintain code integrity and quality

📑 Governance & Administrative Controls

Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

High-level managerial control

Defines rules and guidelines for IT resource usage

Focuses on behavior and oversight rather than technical enforcement

🔐 Identity & Access Management

SSO / Federated Identity

Reduces credential sprawl across SaaS apps

IdP (Identity Provider)

Central authority managing user authentication

Essential first component in federated identity solutions

💣 Malicious Code & Detection

Logic Bomb Example

Date-triggered malicious action

Example: IF DATE(...) THEN DROP DATABASE

Reviewing WAF logs helps:

Identify attack vector (SQLi, command injection, etc.)

Distinguish threat vs vulnerability

🔄 Resiliency & Disaster Recovery

Production Failover (Live Failover)

Most realistic resiliency test

Forces backup systems to handle live production load

Validates:

RTO (Recovery Time Objective)

RPO (Recovery Point Objective)

🔒 Encryption & Secure Transport

TLS 1.3

Best practice for protecting data in transit

Provides encryption, authentication, integrity

More comprehensive than standalone crypto algorithms

📌 Key Reinforcement Areas

Vendor due diligence using SOC 2

Layer 7 protections (WAF vs traditional firewall)

SDLC security controls

Federated identity architecture

Disaster recovery testing validation (RTO/RPO)

Modern secure transport protocols (TLS 1.3)
