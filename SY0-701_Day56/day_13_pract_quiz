📘 CompTIA Security+ — Practice Exam Consolidation

Day 55 Overall | Day 12 of Practice Exams

Overview

Today focused primarily on completing multiple timed practice-exam sections (30 sets of 5 questions) to reinforce core Security+ concepts, improve question interpretation, and identify weak knowledge areas. While minimal new handwritten notes were produced, this session emphasized active recall, pattern recognition, and exam readiness.

🔐 Core Concepts Reinforced
Authentication, Authorization & Access Control

Least Privilege: Users and systems should only have the minimum access required.

Privileged Access Management (PAM): Controls and audits administrative credentials using check-in/check-out, credential rotation, and session monitoring.

Privilege Creep: Gradual accumulation of excess permissions, often during role changes.

Federation & SSO: Authenticate once and access multiple services via trusted identity providers.

PEAP / EAP / RADIUS: Secure network authentication mechanisms commonly used in enterprise wireless environments.

🌐 Network & Application Attacks

Credential Stuffing: Reusing leaked username/password pairs across services.

Password Spraying: Trying common passwords across many accounts.

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Tricks authenticated users into executing unwanted actions.

Directory Traversal: Exploiting path manipulation (../) to access restricted files.

DNS Poisoning / Spoofing: Redirecting traffic by corrupting DNS records.

Evil Twin Attacks: Rogue access points impersonating legitimate Wi-Fi networks.

🛡️ Defensive Security Controls

WAF (Web Application Firewall): Protects against XSS, SQL injection, and other web-based attacks.

NGFW: Application-aware firewall with deep packet inspection.

DLP (Data Loss Prevention): Prevents unauthorized data exfiltration.

EDR: Detects, alerts, and responds to endpoint threats in real time.

FDE (Full Disk Encryption): Protects data at rest if devices are lost or stolen.

Secure Configuration Guides: Reduce attack surface via hardened baselines.

☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure Concepts

CASB: Enforces security policies between users and cloud providers.

Containers vs VMs: Lightweight, isolated application environments.

IaaS: Cloud-provided compute, storage, and networking.

Availability Zones: Physically separate data centers for high availability.

VDI: Centralized desktops accessed remotely.

📜 Risk, Governance & Continuity

BIA (Business Impact Analysis): Determines acceptable data loss and downtime.

BCP / DRP: Plans for operational continuity during disruptions.

MTTR: Mean time to repair failed systems.

SOC 2 Reports: Vendor security assurance for cloud services.

NIST 800-53: Security and privacy controls for federal systems.

ISO 27001: International ISMS standard.

🔎 Vulnerability Management

CVSS: Standardized vulnerability scoring (0–10).

Credentialed vs Non-Credentialed Scans

Continuous Validation: Ongoing testing of security posture.

Nmap: Network discovery and service enumeration tool.

🧠 Security Operations & Testing

Red Team: Simulated attacks (often covert).

Blue Team: Defensive monitoring and response.

Purple Team: Collaborative offense + defense.

Tabletop Exercises: Scenario-based incident response simulations.

🎯 Key Takeaways

Practice exams are increasingly reinforcing scenario recognition over rote memorization.

Many attacks differ subtly — understanding intent, scope, and impact is critical.

Repetition is improving speed and confidence in identifying the best answer, not just a correct one.

Focus is shifting from learning new terms to exam strategy and concept linkage.
