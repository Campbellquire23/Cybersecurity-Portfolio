## 🧱 Video 1.2 — Zero Trust Architecture

### 🔹 Core Concept
- Zero Trust means **never trust, always verify** — every user, device, and system must authenticate and be authorized for *every action*, even inside the network.
- The assumption: every network is hostile, and breaches are inevitable.
- Applies across on-prem, virtual, and cloud environments.

### 🔹 Planes of Operation
- **Data Plane:** Handles traffic, encryption, NAT, and security processing.  
- **Control Plane:** Manages network routing decisions, NAT tables, and firewall rules.  
- **Management Plane:** Defines security policy, access, and administration.

### 🔹 Identity & Access
- **Adaptive Authentication:** Adjusts access control based on user behavior and context (IP, device, location, etc.).  
- **Intent-based Access:** Examines data points like device health, user role, or location before allowing access.  
- **Policy-driven decisions:** Uses multiple factors to determine authentication and authorization needs.

### 🔹 Security Zones
- Segregates the network into **trust boundaries** for better control.
- **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP):** Validates and monitors traffic or user actions.
- **Policy Decision Point (PDP):** Evaluates PEP data and decides whether to allow/deny access.

## 🧱 Video 1.3 — Physical Security & Deception Tools

### 🔹 Physical Security Controls
- **Access Control Vestibules (Mantraps):** One-door-at-a-time entry to prevent tailgating.  
- **Badge & Keycard Systems:** Require authentication to access secure areas.  
- **Cameras & Motion Sensors:** Infrared, ultrasonic, microwave, and photoelectric detection.

### 🔹 Deception & Detection
- **Honeypots:** Fake systems designed to attract attackers and log intrusion behavior.  
- **Honeynets:** Networks of honeypots for advanced analysis.  
- **Honeyfiles:** Fake files (e.g., passwords.txt) containing traceable data to detect theft.  
- **Honeytokens:** Fake data records or credentials to track leaks.  
- Example: a fake “database credentials” file sends an alert if accessed.

### 🔹 Purpose
- Helps analysts study attacker methods.  
- Identifies compromised accounts or insider threats.  
- Strengthens intrusion detection systems by analyzing attack patterns.
