ompTIA Security+ Practice Exams

(Day 5 of Practice Exams | Overall Day 48)

🔑 Topics Reviewed & Reinforced

Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Prevents unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive data through identification, monitoring, and enforcement

Geofencing: Location-based access control using geographic boundaries

OpenSSL: Software library supporting cryptographic functions and SSL/TLS

ARP Poisoning: Attack using forged ARP messages to intercept traffic between devices

Sandboxing: Isolates applications to limit permissions and reduce impact of compromise

CSIRT: Incident response team responsible for handling and coordinating security incidents

Non-PII: Data that does not directly identify individuals but may pose privacy risk if combined

WPA2 / WPA3: Wireless security protocols using strong encryption and authentication

RADIUS: Centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting service

Tor (Onion Routing): Anonymizes traffic through layered encryption and relays

SSL/TLS: Encrypts communication to prevent interception and credential theft

Thin Clients: Minimal local hardware relying on centralized servers

Corrective Controls: Restore systems after an incident

SQL Injection: Exploits improperly sanitized inputs to bypass authentication

Information Exposure Prevention: Reduces leakage via error messages or interfaces

Verbose Error Messages: Risky disclosures that reveal system internals

🎯 Key Takeaways

Continued identification of CompTIA wording traps

Improved understanding of preventive vs corrective controls

Reinforced network security, encryption, and incident response concepts

Practice exams highlighting context-based decision making, not memorization
