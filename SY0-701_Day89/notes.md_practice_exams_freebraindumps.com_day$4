GitHub Summary (Day 89)

Day 89 Overall – SY0-701 FreeBrainDumps Practice Exam (Day 4)
Completed questions 55–75 of the FreeBrainDumps Security+ SY0-701 practice exam. This session focused on governance, authentication security, encryption protocols, vulnerability scanning, and networking technologies including VoIP.

🔎 Topics Reviewed
🏷 Data Governance & Classification

Importance of data classification policies

Enables organizations to apply security controls based on sensitivity levels

🔍 Vulnerability Scanning & Threat Intelligence

Non-credentialed scans identify publicly exposed vulnerabilities (open ports, services)

MITRE ATT&CK framework

Real-world adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)

Used to map threats to mitigation strategies

Nessus vulnerability scanner

Identifies misconfigurations, insecure protocols, weak settings

🌐 Secure Communications

LDAP over SSL/TLS (LDAPS)

Requires trusted certificate validation

Self-signed/internal CA certificates must be trusted locally

Telnet vs SSH

Telnet = plaintext (insecure)

SSH = encrypted secure replacement

⚙ Architecture & Performance

Switching from file-based transfers (SFTP) to API/microservices

Improves scalability and real-time data processing

Wildcards certificates

Cost-effective for multiple subdomains

Serverless architecture

Cloud provider handles infrastructure

Reduces overhead and deployment complexity

🌍 Network & Protocol Concepts

IPv6 tunneling / encapsulation (IPv6-in-IPv4)

Bypasses some IPv4 security controls

/etc/shadow permissions

Stores hashed passwords

Root-only access to prevent offline cracking

RTP, SIP, SRTP

Core VoIP protocols

SIP = session control

RTP = media transport

SRTP = encrypted RTP

⚖ Risk & Compliance

GDPR rights

Right of access

Right to be forgotten

📌 Key Reinforcement Areas

Certificate trust chains

Secure protocol replacements (Telnet → SSH)

IPv6 tunneling security implications

VoIP protocol stack

File permission hardening
