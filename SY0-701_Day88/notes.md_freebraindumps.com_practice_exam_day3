✅ GitHub Summary (Day 88)

Day 88 Overall – SY0-701 FreeBrainDumps Practice Exam (Day 3)
Completed questions 40–55 of the FreeBrainDumps Security+ practice exam. Focused primarily on email security, cryptography usage, access control models, digital forensics concepts, and cloud-related governance risks.

🔎 Topics Reviewed
📧 Email & DNS Security

DNS sinkholes to redirect malicious traffic to controlled servers

S/MIME security and digital signatures

Asymmetric cryptography for non-repudiation

Sender signs with private key

Recipient verifies with public key

🔐 Cryptography & Performance

Resource constraints in IoT devices

Limited CPU, memory, battery

Lightweight cryptographic algorithms are preferred

🌐 Network Access & Authentication

Captive portals

Redirect users to authentication page before internet access

Common in hotels, airports, cafes

Public Wi-Fi risks

Often require credential-based authentication

Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) acknowledgement

🧠 Digital Forensics

RAM is volatile

Must collect volatile memory first during investigations

Importance of preserving evidence in proper order

🛡 Governance & Risk Management

Segregation (Separation) of Duties

Prevents fraud/errors by distributing critical responsibilities

Code repositories as breach sources

Misconfigurations in cloud environments

Credential exposure risks

📌 Key Learning Points

Non-repudiation relies on asymmetric encryption.

IoT cryptography must consider hardware limitations.

Forensics prioritizes volatile data collection.

Cloud misconfigurations and exposed repositories are major risk vectors.
