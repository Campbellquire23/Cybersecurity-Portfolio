✅ Day 83 Notes Summary (GitHub Upload)
Day 83 Overview

Today I completed Union Test Prep Practice Lessons (Walkthrough Style Questions) covering:

Lesson 1: General Security Concepts (20 questions)

Lesson 2: Security Architecture Concepts (continued notes)

This session focused on reviewing key security definitions, encryption concepts, access control models, certificate validation, and infrastructure/security architecture fundamentals.

Key Topics Covered
CIA Triad

Confidentiality ensures only authorized access to information.

Integrity ensures data is accurate and not altered improperly.

Availability ensures systems/data are accessible when needed.

Honeypots

Honeypots are systems designed to attract attackers.

Used to study attacker behavior and detect malicious activity.

Certificate Revocation + Trust Validation

A CRL (Certificate Revocation List) is a list of certificates revoked by a Certificate Authority (CA).

Used when certificates should no longer be trusted before expiration.

Encryption Levels

Reviewed differences between encryption types:

Full Disk Encryption (FDE): encrypts the entire drive.

File Encryption: encrypts individual files.

Partition Encryption: encrypts a section of the disk.

Self-Signed Certificates

Created without a trusted 3rd-party CA.

Useful in internal environments but not trusted publicly by default.

Data Protection Techniques

Data Masking: hides sensitive data fields while keeping format usable.

Tokenization: replaces sensitive values with a unique identifier stored in a lookup table.

Encryption: uses algorithms to protect data confidentiality.

Security Architecture Concepts (Lesson 2)
Failure Modes

Fail-open: allows traffic through during failure.

Fail-closed: blocks traffic during failure (more secure).

Load Balancers

Distribute traffic across multiple systems.

Improve reliability, performance, and reduce strain on single devices.

Unified Threat Management (UTM)

Combines multiple security tools into one system:

Firewall

VPN

IDS/IPS

DLP

Centralized security control and monitoring.

📌 Progress Notes

Union Test Prep walkthrough lessons helped reinforce major Security+ concepts and definitions, especially in encryption, certificates, and security infrastructure design.

Tomorrow’s plan is to complete Lesson 3: Security Operations (20 walkthrough questions).
