Day 84 Overall – Union Test Prep Practice Walkthroughs (Day 2)
Today I completed Union Test Prep practice lesson walkthroughs focused mainly on Security Operations, followed by additional review in Security Program Management & Oversight.

Topics Covered:

Site surveys and how they help plan secure network installations (signal strength, interference, obstacles, infrastructure needs)

Difference between intrusive vs non-intrusive vulnerability scans

SIEM systems as centralized tools for collecting and analyzing log/security event data

Data retention policies and how long organizations must securely store information for compliance

Understanding false positives in security monitoring tools (alerts triggered with no actual threat)

Security Program Management & Oversight Concepts:

Industry regulations and compliance frameworks (ex: PCI DSS)

Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) used to monitor security risk trends and effectiveness of controls

Risk transference (shifting risk to another party such as insurance providers)

Difference between guidelines vs legal requirements

Risk assessment fundamentals and decision-making based on:
Severity = Probability × Impact

Progress Notes:

This walkthrough format is helping reinforce definitions and real-world applications, but still requires repetition to improve recall speed and accuracy.
