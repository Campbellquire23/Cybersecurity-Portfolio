46 – Practice Exam Review Summary (for GitHub)
📘 CompTIA Security+ – Practice Exam Review (Day 3)

Today focused on practice exam questions, identifying weak areas, and writing definitions for missed concepts. The emphasis shifted from content consumption to exam readiness and knowledge reinforcement.

🔐 Key Concepts Reviewed

Authentication & Access Control

3FA (Three-Factor Authentication):

Something you know (password)

Something you have (token/smart card)

Something you are (biometrics)

802.1X: Network access control using EAP between supplicant, authenticator, and authentication server

Prevents unauthorized devices from accessing LAN/WLAN

Network & Infrastructure Resilience

Load Balancing: Distributes traffic across multiple servers to improve performance, availability, and fault tolerance

RAID: Combines multiple physical disks into one logical unit for redundancy, reliability, and performance

Jump Servers: Intermediate systems used to securely access internal resources

Threats & Attacks

Brute Force Attacks: Repeated attempts to guess passwords or encryption keys

Buffer Overflow: Exploiting excess data written to memory buffers

On-Path (MITM) Attacks: Intercepting or modifying traffic between two endpoints

Endpoint & Network Security

EDR: Monitors endpoints to detect and respond to malicious activity

IDS: Monitors traffic patterns and detects anomalies

SASE: Cloud-based framework combining networking and security services

Application & Software Security

Input Validation: Prevents injection attacks by sanitizing user input

Application Allow Lists: Only approved applications are allowed to run

Firmware: Embedded software in hardware devices; outdated firmware can introduce vulnerabilities

Code Signing: Verifies software authenticity and integrity

Risk Mitigation

Compensating Controls: Alternative controls used when primary controls aren’t feasible

Cold Sites: Backup data centers without active hardware; longest recovery time

🧠 Learning Outcome

Practice exams revealed gaps in application-level understanding, not lack of effort. Reviewing incorrect answers and writing definitions is strengthening long-term retention and exam performance.
