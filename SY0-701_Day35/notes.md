Day 35 Summary — Logs, Monitoring, Security Policies, BC/DR, & SDLC
1. Security Log Types & Sources
Network Logs

Generated by:

Switches

Routers

VPNs

Access points

Track:

Access attempts

Authentication failures

Routing changes

Connection issues

Firewall Logs

Show:

Allowed/blocked traffic

Source & destination IPs

Ports and protocols

URLs accessed

Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW):

Include application-level visibility

Detect anomalies and suspicious traffic

Application Logs

Specific to each application

May include:

Windows Event Logs

Linux /var/log

macOS logs

Used to diagnose:

Errors

Crashes

Misconfigurations

Endpoint Logs

Generated from user devices:

Login events

System changes

Policy enforcement

Malware detections

Often forwarded to SIEM

Used with correlation to link multiple security events

2. OS-Specific Security Logs

Monitor:

File access

File changes

Authentication attempts

Privilege escalation

Used to:

Detect brute-force attacks

Identify disabled services

Discover suspicious processes

Filtering may be required so only important events are sent to SIEM

3. IPS / IDS Logs

Usually integrated into firewalls

Include:

Vulnerability signatures

Attack classifications

Source and destination data

Timestamps

Ports and protocols

Detect:

Known exploits

Scanning activity

Policy violations

4. Metadata & Data Context

Metadata describes other data:

Email headers

File ownership

Phone numbers

Locations

IP addresses

Used to:

Trace attackers

Build attack timelines

Correlate logs across systems

5. Vulnerability Scanning

Identifies:

Missing patches

Weak configurations

Unprotected systems

Detects:

Outdated OS versions

Default credentials

Open services

Helps find:

New vulnerabilities

Old unpatched systems

Results are often included in automated reports

6. Automated Reports & Dashboards

Most SIEMs generate:

Scheduled security reports

Compliance reports

Reports may be:

Easy or complex to create

Built-in or from third-party tools

Dashboards:

Show real-time security data

Highlight the most important alerts

Designed for fast decision-making

Often not meant for long-term deep analysis

Packet capture tools provide:

Deep traffic inspection

Identification of unknown traffic

Validation of filtering rules

7. Security Policies Overview

Define rules and expectations for users and systems

Include:

High-level strategy

Storage requirements

Security controls

Enforcement procedures

Centralized reference for all security processes

Include:

Compliance requirements

Roles and responsibilities

Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

Defines what users can and cannot do

Covers:

Internet usage

Devices

Software

Helps:

Limit liability

Enforce discipline if policies are violated

8. Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery
Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

Ensures business operations continue

Includes:

Alternative processes

Manual operations

Backup workflows

Must be written before a disaster occurs

Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

Focuses on IT system restoration

Includes:

Data recovery

System restoration

Application recovery

Staff availability

Disasters can be:

Natural

Technical

Human-caused

DR is a subset of BCP

9. Security Incidents & Incident Response Roles

Example incidents:

Phishing → malware execution

DDoS / botnet attacks

Confidential data theft

Must have:

Documented incident response policies

Clearly defined response roles

Incident Response Teams

Specialized and trained

Include:

IT Security Management (oversight)

Technical Staff (boots on the ground)

Compliance Officers

Legal Support

US-CERT can assist in large national incidents

10. Software / Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Also called:

Systems Development Life Cycle

Application Development Life Cycle

Common SDLC Models

Waterfall:

Requirements → Design → Develop → Test → Deploy → Maintain

Agile:

Fast, continuous testing and deployment

Iterative updates

11. Change Management

Governs how changes are made to systems

Includes:

Installation schedules

Downtime windows

Rollback procedures

Difficult to implement

Requires:

Organization-wide discipline

Cultural buy-in
