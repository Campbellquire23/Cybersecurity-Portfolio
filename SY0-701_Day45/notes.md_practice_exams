Security Controls & Architecture

Input validation: Prevents malicious input (XSS, injection) before processing

Sideloading: Installing apps outside official stores (security risk)

NAC (Network Access Control):

Enforces device compliance before network access

Can restrict or quarantine non-compliant devices

Application Allow List:

Only approved applications may run

Strong defense against malware

🧠 Monitoring & Detection

EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response):

Monitors endpoints (PCs, phones, servers)

Detects malware, ransomware, suspicious behavior

IDS:

Network-based monitoring

Detects suspicious traffic but does NOT block

☁️ Modern Network Security

SASE (Secure Access Service Edge):

Cloud-based

Combines networking + security

Ideal for remote/hybrid workers

Secures access to cloud apps and data centers

🧪 Testing & Environment Knowledge

Partially Known Environment (Gray Box Test):

Tester has limited knowledge (IP ranges, OS, etc.)

Focuses testing effort efficiently

Jump Server:

Acts as a controlled gateway

Prevents direct access to internal resources

🛡️ Business Continuity

Cold Site:

No live infrastructure

Longest recovery time

Lowest cost

Compensating Controls:

Used when primary controls aren’t feasible

Example: firewall + service hardening for legacy systems
