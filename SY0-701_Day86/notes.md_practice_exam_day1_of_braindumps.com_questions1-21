Day 86 Overall – Security+ (SY0-701) Practice Quiz (Day 1)
Today I completed Day 1 of Security+ SY0-701 practice quizzes, working through 20 practice questions using a new quiz resource site (FreeBrainDumps). This session was focused on reinforcing core exam concepts by identifying correct answers and reviewing definitions tied to security monitoring, threat detection, mitigation techniques, and infrastructure security.

Topics Covered:

IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and how it identifies threats using defined signatures

Security automation and automated response actions in incident response workflows

SIEM systems and the role of centralized logging/monitoring

Deterrent vs. detective security controls

Scripting (PowerShell / Bash) as a common tool in automation and cybersecurity tasks

False positives and their impact on vulnerability scanning and alert accuracy

Port security as a mitigation method for limiting unauthorized device access

Jailbreaking risks and how it affects mobile device security posture

Incident response “lessons learned” phase

Vulnerability scanning and identifying outdated/legacy systems

VPN usage for secure remote access and encrypted communication

Unified Threat Management (UTM) for combining multiple security controls

Containerization and its benefits for system architecture and workload efficiency

Progress Notes:

This quiz session helped reinforce foundational Security+ concepts while building repetition with exam-style questions. Moving forward, continued practice quizzes will be used to improve speed, accuracy, and familiarity with exam terminology.
