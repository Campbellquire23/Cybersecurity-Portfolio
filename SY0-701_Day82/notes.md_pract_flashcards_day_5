Overall Day: 82
Flashcards Day: 5
Focus: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations
Study Set: 20 flashcards + definitions

🔥 Key Topics Covered
Threat Actor & Attack Types

Trojan Horse: Malware disguised as legitimate software that provides attackers unauthorized access.

Password Spraying: Attempts one common password across many usernames to avoid lockouts.

Buffer Overflow Attack: Occurs when too much data is written into a memory space, allowing code execution.

DDoS Attack: Distributed Denial of Service attack using many systems to overwhelm a target.

Watchlist Attack: Attackers compromise commonly visited sites to infect users who visit them.

Threat Actor Categories

Hacktivist: Politically/ideologically motivated attacker trying to disrupt or expose information.

Unskilled Attackers (Script Kiddies): Low-skill attackers using pre-made tools/scripts.

APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats): Long-term, well-funded (often nation-state) attackers targeting systems for espionage or sabotage.

Criminal Syndicates: Organized cybercrime groups that conduct advanced attacks for profit.

Vulnerability Concepts

Zero-Day Threats: Unknown/unpatched vulnerabilities that attackers exploit before a fix exists.

Legacy Systems: Older systems no longer receiving updates, making them vulnerable.

DNS Cache Poisoning: Attack modifies DNS cache to redirect users to malicious sites.

Supply Chain & Software Risks

Side Loading: Installing unauthorized apps outside official distribution methods.

Supply Chain Attacks: Attackers compromise vendors/providers, affecting multiple organizations.

Exploitation Methods

Race Condition (TOCTOU): Exploits timing gaps between security checks and use of resources.

Image-Based Attacks: Malware hidden inside image files.

Blackmail / Extortion: Threatening to release sensitive info unless demands are met.

🧠 Quick Takeaway

Today’s flashcards focused heavily on real-world cyber threats, threat actor classifications, and high-impact vulnerabilities like zero-days, buffer overflows, and DNS poisoning — which are core Security+ exam topics.
