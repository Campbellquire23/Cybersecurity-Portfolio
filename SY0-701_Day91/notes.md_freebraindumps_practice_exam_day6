itHub Summary (Day 91)

Day 91 Overall – SY0-701 FreeBrainDumps Practice Exam (Day 6)
Completed questions 80–90 of the FreeBrainDumps Security+ SY0-701 practice exam. Today’s session focused on packet analysis, application security testing, vulnerability scoring, post-exploitation techniques, DNS misconfigurations, and security frameworks.

🔎 Topics Reviewed
🧪 Network Analysis & Packet Inspection

Wireshark

Used for real-time packet capture and analysis

Detects plaintext credential transmission

Validates whether sensitive data is exposed on the network

🛠 Application Security Testing

Fuzzing

Automated testing using invalid/random inputs

Identifies crashes, logic errors, and exploitable vulnerabilities

OWASP

Web application security standards

OWASP Top 10 (e.g., injection, broken access control, etc.)

📊 Risk & Vulnerability Assessment

CVSS

Used to score severity of vulnerabilities

Change Management

Structured process for addressing design flaws

Includes review, impact analysis, rollback planning, stakeholder communication

🧠 Post-Exploitation & Credential Attacks

Mimikatz (Sekurlsa::pth)

Extracts credentials from memory

Supports Pass-the-Hash attacks

NTLM Hash

Can be reused for authentication without cracking password

🌐 DNS & Network Footprinting

AXFR (Zone Transfer)

Used for DNS replication between servers

If misconfigured, attackers can retrieve full DNS record lists

DNS misconfigurations can expose:

Hostnames

Subdomains

Internal IP addressing schemes

🔐 Defensive Monitoring & Architecture

WAF

Protects against application-layer attacks (SQLi, XSS)

NIPS

Detects and blocks malicious network traffic patterns

Conditional Access Policies

Used in Azure/Entra ID environments

Enforce zero-trust access decisions

📌 Key Reinforcement Areas

Packet inspection for plaintext credential exposure

Pass-the-Hash mechanics

DNS zone transfer exploitation risks

Application-layer vs network-layer protection differences

Vulnerability scoring interpretation
