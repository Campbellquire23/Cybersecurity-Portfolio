Day 74 Summary – CompTIA Security+

Focus: Security Architecture (Practice Quiz – 20 Questions)

Core Topics Covered

Power & Availability

UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply): Provides short-term backup power during outages or fluctuations, allowing systems to shut down gracefully and preventing data loss.

Elasticity: The ability of systems (especially cloud environments) to automatically scale resources up or down based on demand.

Network Access & Segmentation

Jump Servers: Act as controlled connection points between security zones. They are highly restricted, logged, and isolated to prevent unauthorized lateral movement.

Security Zones: Logical or physical network separations that limit access and contain threats within defined boundaries.

Air Gaps: Physical isolation of a network segment with no logical or physical connection to external systems, preventing remote access entirely.

Unified & Layered Security

UTM (Unified Threat Management): Combines multiple security functions (firewall, IDS/IPS, VPN, DLP, etc.) into a single centralized interface for simplified management and visibility.

Appropriate Data Security by State:

Data in Transit: Encryption (VPN, TLS/IPSec), integrity checks

Data in Use: Strong access controls, role-based permissions

Data at Rest: Encryption, physical security, strict access policies

Network Architecture Models

Decentralized Architecture: Distributes infrastructure across multiple locations (e.g., cloud or hybrid environments) to improve resilience.

Centralized Architecture: Concentrates network infrastructure in a single primary location (on-prem or data center).

Architecture vs Infrastructure:

Architecture = how the network is designed and organized

Infrastructure = the hardware/software components that implement that design

Operational & Specialized Systems

RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems): Used in environments requiring immediate response (medical devices, industrial systems). Prioritizes deterministic timing over throughput.

Pacemaker Example: RTOS can detect abnormal heart rhythms and immediately alert or respond without delay.

Failure Behavior & Networking Standards

Fail-Open vs Fail-Closed:

Fail-Open: Allows traffic when a system fails (availability prioritized)

Fail-Closed: Blocks traffic when a system fails (security prioritized)

IEEE: Organization responsible for networking standards such as 802.1X, used for wired and wireless network authentication.

VPN Configurations

Full Tunnel VPN: Routes all traffic through the VPN.

Split Tunnel VPN: Routes only specific traffic through the VPN, allowing other traffic to bypass it.

Resilience & Recovery

Failover: Automatically shifts operations from a primary system to a backup system. Highly intrusive but provides the most accurate validation of resilience and recovery performance.

📌 Key Takeaways

Strong security architecture balances availability, segmentation, and control.

Isolation techniques (jump servers, zones, air gaps) significantly reduce attack surface.

Understanding failure behavior (fail-open vs fail-closed) is critical for real-world decision-making.

RTOS and specialized systems emphasize speed and determinism over flexibility.

This quiz showed improved performance and confidence in architecture concepts.
