Day 87 Overall – Security+ SY0-701 FreeBrainDumps Practice Exam (Day 2)
Today I completed Day 2 of the FreeBrainDumps Security+ SY0-701 practice exam, covering questions 21–40. This session focused heavily on identity and access management, monitoring/detection techniques, and governance concepts used in enterprise cybersecurity environments.

Topics Covered:

AAA authentication framework (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)

RADIUS server functionality for centralized authentication

Version control and why it supports integrity, traceability, and auditability

Red team testing to identify exploitable vulnerabilities in systems

Trusted devices and authentication tied to endpoint trust

Honeypots vs. honeynets and detection of attacker activity

DNS sinkholes for disrupting malicious outbound DNS traffic

Hashing for verifying file integrity and preventing tampering

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and its role in SSO

On-path / MITM attacks and interception of communications

Residual risk and how it remains after controls are implemented

Progress Notes:

This practice set reinforced key Security+ terms and definitions, especially around authentication services and threat detection strategies. Continued repetition through large-scale question banks will help improve accuracy and long-term recall.
