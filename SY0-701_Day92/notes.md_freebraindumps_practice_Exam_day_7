✅ GitHub Summary (Day 92)

Day 92 Overall – SY0-701 FreeBrainDumps Practice Exam (Day 7)
Completed questions 90–100 of the FreeBrainDumps Security+ SY0-701 practice exam. Although only 10 questions were completed, this session focused on in-depth analysis of security architecture, monitoring models, secure coding practices, supply chain risks, and vendor governance.

🔎 Topics Reviewed
🧹 Asset & Device Management

Decommissioning

Best action for numerous unused/non-compliant endpoints

Sanitization

Secure removal of data from storage devices

Maintains hardware usability while protecting sensitive data

🔐 Authentication & Access Security

TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password)

Changes every 30–60 seconds

Combines secret key + current time

Does not require network connectivity

Widely supported across platforms

🔗 Supply Chain Security

Supply Chain Attacks

Occur when trusted third-party software/vendor is compromised

Can inject malicious updates into environments

Illumination Tools

Map supply chain vendors, dependencies, and locations

Identify single points of failure and hidden risks

💻 Web & Application Security

Web Shell

Malicious script uploaded to a web server

Provides remote administration capabilities to attackers

Often connects outbound to suspicious IP addresses or ports

📡 Monitoring & Security Testing

Agentless Monitoring

Collects endpoint data without installing software agents

Uses built-in protocols (SSH, WMI, SNMP, APIs)

Static Analysis (SAST)

Examines source code without executing it

Identifies flaws early in development

Detects hardcoded credentials and insecure logic

📑 Governance & Legal Controls

NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)

Limits disclosure of sensitive information

Used in vendor and external business relationships

📌 Key Reinforcement Areas

Data lifecycle management (sanitization vs decommissioning)

MFA implementation (TOTP mechanics)

Supply chain mapping and third-party risk

Static code analysis vs runtime testing

Web shell indicators and detection
