✅ Day 75 Summary

Overall Day: 75
Practice Quizzes: Day 31
Focus Area: Security Operations (CompTIA Security+)

🔐 Security Operations – Key Concepts Reviewed

1. Authentication, Identity, and Access

Federation: Enables authentication across multiple systems using trusted Identity Providers (IdPs) like Google or Apple.

Biometric Authentication: Uses physical traits (fingerprints, retina scans) to verify identity.

Deprovisioning: The formal process of terminating user access, including account deletion, credential revocation, and removal of residual data.

DAC (Discretionary Access Control): Resource owners control access permissions; commonly used in non-networked or smaller environments.

2. Secure Communications & Protocols

IMAP / POP3: Email retrieval protocols secured using SSL/TLS for encrypted transport.

SSL/TLS: Provides encrypted communication at the transport layer to protect data confidentiality and integrity.

Code Signing: Uses PKI to digitally sign software, ensuring authenticity and integrity by validating against trusted certificates.

3. Monitoring, Detection, and Analysis

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):

Collects logs from multiple sources

Correlates events and trends

Provides dashboards for high-level security visibility

Packet Monitoring: Captures and analyzes network packets to detect anomalies and suspicious activity.

NetFlow: Monitors network traffic metadata (IPs, ports, protocols) to analyze traffic patterns and bandwidth usage.

Local DLP Alerts: Triggered when sensitive data exceeds normal thresholds or violates policy.

4. Wireless & Network Planning

RF (Radio Frequency): Used for wireless communications; Wi-Fi commonly operates on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.

Site Surveys: Conducted before wireless deployment to assess signal strength, interference, coverage gaps, and optimal AP placement.

Security Zones: Segment networks physically or logically to isolate sensitive systems and limit lateral movement.

5. Device & Deployment Models

COPE (Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled):

Devices owned and controlled by the organization

Limited personal use permitted

Greater enterprise control compared to BYOD

Asset Control: Enterprise-owned devices allow stronger enforcement of security policies and monitoring.

6. Incident Response & Data Handling

Local DLP: Detects abnormal data movement requiring escalation beyond standard operations.

Security Operations Workflow: Monitoring → Detection → Analysis → Response → Recovery
