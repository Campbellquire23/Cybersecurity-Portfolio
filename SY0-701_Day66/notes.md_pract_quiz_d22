Day 66 Summary — Practice Quizzes (Day 22)

Today focused heavily on incident response, risk analysis, identity management, network security controls, malware behavior, and data protection concepts. Although accuracy is still around 40–50%, note-taking depth and conceptual coverage are strong.

🔍 Incident Response & Risk

Incident Analysis is a core IR activity involving evidence collection, log analysis, timeline reconstruction, and identifying root cause, attacker motives, and capabilities.

Risk Assessment evaluates both likelihood and impact of threats.

ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy) estimates yearly financial risk:

ALE = SLE × ARO

SLE = cost of a single incident

ARO = expected frequency per year

Used heavily for cost justification (e.g., insurance, security investments).

🧠 Threat Actors & Malware

Cyber organized crime groups are well-funded, sophisticated, and financially motivated.

Often overlap with APT-style tactics.

Ransomware encrypts victim data and demands payment for decryption keys (example: Ryuk).

Memory injection vulnerabilities allow malicious code execution inside legitimate processes, often bypassing traditional defenses.

🔐 Identity, Authentication & Certificates

OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) verifies whether a certificate is still valid and not revoked.

Browsers validate:

Certificate is issued by a trusted CA

Certificate is valid and not revoked

Identity Providers (IdP) centralize authentication and enable SSO using protocols like SAML or OIDC.

🌐 Network & Application Security

Port security restricts which devices can connect to network switch ports.

Input validation is a primary defense against XSS by sanitizing user input.

Behavior-based rules analyze traffic patterns to detect anomalies and mitigate attacks like DDoS.

NGFWs rely on behavioral analysis rather than static signatures alone.

🗂️ Data Protection & Privacy

DLP (Data Loss Prevention) systems identify, monitor, and protect sensitive data using classification labels and policies.

Loss assessment preserves logs and artifacts off-site for future forensic analysis.

GDPR roles:

Data Controller determines purpose and means of processing

Data Processor processes data on behalf of the controller

Clear role definition is critical for building and maintaining a compliant data privacy program.

📊 Overall Progress

Still scoring ~40–50%, but:

Notes are detailed and improving

Breadth of concepts is expanding rapidly

Focus is shifting from memorization → understanding relationships between controls, threats, and risk
