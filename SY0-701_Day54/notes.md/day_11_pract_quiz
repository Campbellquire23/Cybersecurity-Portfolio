Summary for GitHub Upload

🔐 Core Topics Covered
Authentication, Encryption & Trust

SSL/TLS: Encrypts data in transit, ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

PKI & Certificates: Digital certificates verify identity; validity periods define trust windows.

DNS Poisoning / Spoofing: Redirects traffic by corrupting DNS cache records.

Credential Stuffing: Uses leaked credentials across multiple services exploiting password reuse.

Access Control & Privileges

Privilege Creep: Gradual accumulation of excess permissions increases attack surface.

Least Privilege: Restricts users to minimum permissions required.

Privileged Access Management (PAM): Controls, monitors, and rotates privileged credentials.

chmod (Linux): Modifies file/directory permissions to reduce unauthorized access.

SetUID Bit: Can elevate execution privileges — risky if misconfigured.

Security Operations & Teams

Purple Team: Combines Red Team (attack) and Blue Team (defense) for continuous improvement.

Secure Configuration Guides: Standardized best practices to reduce vulnerabilities.

CVSS: Quantifies vulnerability severity (0–10) based on exploitability and impact.

Data Protection

Full Disk Encryption (FDE): Protects data at rest even if device is lost or stolen.

Integrity: Ensures data is accurate, unaltered, and trustworthy.

Password Hashing: One-way function protecting stored credentials.

Wireless & Network Attacks

Evil Twin Attack: Rogue access point mimicking legitimate SSID to intercept traffic.

DNS Cache Poisoning: Injects false DNS records to redirect users.

ARP/DNS Exploits: Facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks.
