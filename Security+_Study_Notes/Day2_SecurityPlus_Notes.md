# Security+ Study Notes — Day 2

**Topics Covered:**
- CIA Triad
- AAA Framework (Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)
- Non-Repudiation (Integrity, Proof of Origin)
- Authorization Models
- Gap Analysis
- NIST SP 800-171

---

## CIA Triad (CIA)
**Confidentiality** — preventing unauthorized disclosure of information  
**Integrity** — ensuring data remains accurate and unmodified  
**Availability** — systems/services must be up, running, and redundant

---

## AAA Framework
**Identification** — Who you claim to be (e.g., username)  
**Authentication** — Proving who you are (password, MFA)  
**Authorization** — What you’re permitted to access  
**Accounting** — Logs actions & resource usage (logins/data transferred)

---

## Non-Repudiation
- Proof you **said** or **did** something (signatures, digital certs)
- Proof of origin & integrity together

---

## Authorization Models
Used to assign access to users/devices and control resource access

---

## Gap Analysis
- Compare current state vs. security objectives
- Identify weaknesses and missing controls
- Follows standards like **NIST SP 800-171** for protecting CUI
- Result = Formal gap analysis report with recommendations

### Quick Review Questions
1. What ensures data isn’t modified without detection?  
   → **Integrity**
2. Which AAA element proves who you are?  
   → **Authentication**
3. Which NIST doc protects CUI?  
   → **800-171**
4. Which logs data sent/received and logins?  
   → **Accounting**
5. What ensures systems remain operational (redundancy)?  
   → **Availability**
