Day 85 Overall – Union Test Prep Walkthroughs (Day 3)
Today I completed Day 3 of Union Test Prep practice lesson walkthroughs, focused on Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations through a 20-question guided activity.

Topics Covered:

Birthday attack (hash collision probability concept)

SQL injection and how attackers exploit input fields to manipulate databases

Race conditions / TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) vulnerabilities

DNS poisoning and redirecting users to malicious destinations

Impersonation & social engineering tactics

VM escape and how attackers can break out of a virtual machine environment

Side-loading (installing unauthorized apps outside official distribution methods)

Ransomware and its impact through encryption/extortion

Amplified DDoS attacks using smaller queries to generate massive traffic responses

Privilege escalation to gain higher access (root/admin)

Password spraying and its difference from brute force methods

Progress Notes:

This walkthrough reinforced real-world threat concepts and attack methods. Next step is transitioning into higher-volume practice testing using ExamCompass quizzes (25 questions each) to improve accuracy and exam readiness.
