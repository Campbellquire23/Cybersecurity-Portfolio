🧠 Key Concepts Reviewed & Learned
🔐 Application & Network Security

Input Sanitization – Prevents attackers from injecting malicious input (SQLi, XSS) by validating and filtering user data.

Web Application Firewall (WAF) – Inspects and filters HTTP/S traffic to protect web apps from attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and DoS.

Directory Traversal – Attack that exploits improper input validation to access files outside the intended directory using ../ patterns.

Privilege Escalation – Exploiting flaws to gain higher-level permissions than authorized.

ARP Poisoning – Attacker sends fake ARP messages to associate their MAC address with another device’s IP to intercept traffic.

On-Path (Man-in-the-Middle) Attack – Intercepts or modifies traffic between two communicating parties.

☁️ Infrastructure, Availability & Resilience

Load Balancer – Distributes traffic across servers to improve availability, performance, and fault tolerance.

Server Farm – Group of servers providing the same service to support redundancy and scalability.

MTTR (Mean Time to Repair) – Average time required to restore failed equipment or services.

UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) – Provides short-term power and enables graceful shutdown during outages.

Tabletop Exercise – Discussion-based disaster recovery test without disrupting operations.

Business Impact Analysis (BIA) – Identifies critical business functions and the impact of disruptions.

🔑 Authentication, Encryption & Access Control

Digital Certificates – Provide authentication, encryption, and non-repudiation.

Wildcard Certificates – Secure multiple subdomains under one certificate.

SSL/TLS – Encrypts data in transit to prevent credential theft and tampering.

RADIUS – Centralized authentication for network access (often used with 802.1X).

Tor Network – Routes traffic through encrypted relays to anonymize communication.

Thin Clients – Minimal devices that rely on centralized servers, reducing attack surface.

🧯 Incident Response & Governance

CERT / CSIRT – Incident response teams responsible for handling security incidents and enforcing response plans.

Communications Plan – Defines how information is shared internally and externally during incidents.

Shadow IT – Use of unauthorized apps or devices by employees, increasing security risk.

Surveillance Systems – High-risk targets due to internet exposure and default configurations.

Internet Bots – Automated scripts that can be benign or malicious.
