Penetration Testing & Security Awareness
1. Penetration Testing Overview (Video 5.5)
Physical Penetration Testing

Tests whether physical security controls can be bypassed

Examples:

Gaining access to buildings

Tailgating

Accessing restricted areas

Physical security is often the weakest link if controls aren’t enforced

2. Penetration Testing Perspectives
Known Environment

Tester has:

Full knowledge of systems

Network diagrams and configurations

Used to:

Validate controls

Test known defenses

Partially Known Environment

Tester has:

Some information

Common real-world testing scenario

Unknown Environment

Tester has no prior knowledge

Simulates a true external attacker

3. Reconnaissance Phase

Goal: Gather information before exploiting anything

Passive Reconnaissance

No direct interaction with target systems

Examples:

Public websites

Social media

Job postings

Online forums

Harder to detect

Active Reconnaissance

Direct interaction with systems

Examples:

Port scans

DNS queries

OS fingerprinting

Service/version scans

Visible in:

Network traffic

Logs

4. Exploitation Focus

Identify:

Vulnerable systems

Misconfigurations

Exposed services

Reduce attack surface by:

Disabling unused services

Tightening configurations

✅ 5. Security Awareness (Video 5.6)
Phishing Awareness

Many organizations run phishing campaigns

Often:

Automated

Designed to test user behavior

Users may receive:

Immediate feedback after clicking

Recognizing Phishing Indicators

Spelling and grammar errors

Domain inconsistencies

Unexpected attachments

Requests for personal or login information

Urgent or threatening language

Response to Suspicious Messages

Never:

Click suspicious links

Open unknown attachments

Report phishing attempts immediately

Organizations should have:

Clear phishing reporting processes

Monitoring & Metrics

Track:

Click rates

Repeat offenders

Frequency of incidents

First offense:

Training opportunity

Recurring offenses:

Identify patterns

Adjust training strategy

6. Security Awareness Program Development
Program Goals

Reduce human risk

Improve detection

Encourage reporting

Key Components

Minimum awareness baseline

Ongoing training

Multiple delivery methods:

Emails

Posters

In-person training

Simulated phishing

7. Execution & Measurement

Define metrics:

Click-through rates

Reporting rates

Identify stakeholders

Deploy training materials

Track user participation

Use automated reporting where possible

Improve weak areas over time

🧠 Big Picture (Why This Matters)

This day ties together:

Offensive security (pentesting)

Defensive controls

Human behavior (biggest attack vector)

This is very testable content on Security+ and very real-world for SOC, blue team, and GRC roles.
