Day 77 (Overall) – Day 33 Practice Quizzes (Threats, Vulnerabilities, & Mitigations)
Overview

Today’s study session focused on threat actors, attack types, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies through a 20-question CompTIA Security+ practice quiz. The main goal was improving understanding of how real-world attacks occur and how organizations identify and respond to them.

Key Concepts Reviewed
Birthday Attack

A cryptographic-based attack that exploits hash collision probability.

Based on the idea that in a group of about 23 people, there is already a ~50% chance two share the same birthday.

In cybersecurity, this translates to the likelihood that two different inputs can produce the same hash output, which weakens integrity controls.

Log/Event Analysis (Indicators of Attack)

A large number of log entries showing repeated GET requests directed toward a URL can indicate an attack such as:

SQL Injection

Automated probing / scanning attempts

Reconnaissance behavior

TOCTOU Vulnerability (Time of Check to Time of Use)

A type of race condition vulnerability.

Happens when a system checks something (like file permissions), but between the check and the actual use, the condition changes.

Example: user permissions change after validation but before access is granted.

DNS Poisoning

A man-in-the-middle style attack where a malicious actor intercepts DNS requests and redirects users to a fraudulent site.

The attacker makes a malicious IP address appear to be a legitimate domain destination.

Legacy Systems

A security risk caused by outdated hardware/software that is no longer patched, updated, or supported.

Creates vulnerabilities due to:

unpatched exploits

weak encryption

outdated authentication methods

Hacktivists

Threat actors motivated by ideology, political beliefs, or social causes.

Often use attacks such as:

Website defacement

DDoS attacks

Data leaks/doxxing

Threat Actor Motivation

Threat actors can be driven by many motivations including:

Financial gain

Political beliefs

Revenge

Chaos/disruption

Data theft and exposure

VM Escape

Occurs when an attacker breaks out of a virtual machine and gains access to the host environment.

This can allow movement into other VMs, creating a much larger compromise.

Side Loading

Occurs when data/software is installed or transferred through unauthorized channels.

Often involves:

installing malicious apps

using unofficial sources

unauthorized 3rd party transfers

Ransomware

Malware that encrypts files/data and prevents access until a ransom is paid.

Usually financially motivated.

Amplified DDoS Attack

A DDoS attack that overwhelms a network using small requests that generate massive responses.

Attacker uses reflection/amplification to increase traffic volume dramatically.

Privilege Escalation

The process of gaining higher access levels (user → admin/root).

Gives attackers control and visibility across systems.

Password Spraying

A brute-force technique where attackers try common passwords across many accounts instead of many passwords on one account.

Often avoids account lockout detection.

Cryptographic Key Length

Longer key length = stronger encryption.

Shorter keys are easier to brute force and compromise.

Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption: uses a public and private key pair.

Symmetric encryption: uses the same key for encryption and decryption.

OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)

Used to check certificate validity in real time.

Alternative to CRL (Certificate Revocation List), which is less real-time and can be slower.

Progress Notes

Continued strengthening understanding of real-world security concepts even if quiz scores are still not perfect.

Focus today was building knowledge on threat identification and vulnerability recognition.
