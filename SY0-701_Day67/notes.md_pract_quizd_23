Day 67 Summary — Practice Quizzes (Day 23)

Focus: Security operations, zero trust, data protection, application security, and modern cloud architecture concepts.

Today’s session covered a wide range of security fundamentals and operational practices encountered in recent practice quizzes:

Security Playbooks:
Step-by-step procedural guides used by SOC teams to respond consistently to specific security incidents.

Disaster Recovery (DR) vs. Business Continuity (BCP):

DR focuses on restoring IT systems after a disaster.

BCP ensures critical business operations continue during and after a disruption using alternate processes, sites, and recovery plans.

Zero Trust Architecture:
Emphasizes “never trust, always verify,” micro-segmentation, and least privilege access to reduce blast radius if a breach occurs.

Threat Scope Reduction:
Dividing networks into isolated segments to limit lateral movement and minimize the impact of a compromised system.

High Availability in Critical Applications:
Systems (e.g., medical or emergency apps) must be continuously available since downtime can directly affect health and safety.

Password Spraying Indicators:
Suspicious IPs, many failed logins across multiple accounts, and repeated attempts from the same source.

Data Loss Prevention (DLP):
Used to monitor, detect, and block unauthorized transmission of sensitive data (e.g., preventing an employee from emailing customer lists externally).

Ransomware:
Malware that encrypts victim data and demands payment for decryption keys (e.g., Ryuk).

Behavior-Based Detection (NGFW/IDS):
Identifies anomalies by comparing traffic patterns against known normal behavior to detect evolving attacks.

Loss Assessment:
Collecting and preserving logs and forensic data in centralized off-site storage for future analysis and investigations.

Data Privacy Roles (GDPR):

Data Controller: Determines the purpose and means of processing personal data.

Data Processor: Processes data on behalf of the controller.
Establishing clear responsibility is essential for compliance.

Research & Development (R&D):
Generates new products, processes, and intellectual property — often the most valuable and sensitive business assets.

Intellectual Property (IP):
Includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, and proprietary designs — critical assets requiring strong protection.

Identity Proofing:
Verifies a user’s identity before granting access or MFA resets, helping prevent social engineering attacks.

Secure SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):
Integrates security policies, secure coding practices, access control, and testing throughout application development.

Serverless Architecture (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions):
Allows developers to deploy code without managing servers.
Cloud providers handle scaling, patching, and maintenance, enabling faster CI/CD and reduced infrastructure overhead.
