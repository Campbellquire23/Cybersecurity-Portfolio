# Day 5 — CompTIA Security+ Study (1.4 Encryption Concepts & PKI)

## Topics Covered
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption
- Full-disk and file-level encryption
- VPN encryption
- Key stretching
- Obfuscation

## Key Concepts

### 🔐 PKI & Key Pairs
- Public key = encrypts + verifies signature
- Private key = decrypts + signs
- Certificates issued by Certificate Authority (CA)

### 🔑 Encryption Types
| Type | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
Symmetric | Fast bulk data encryption | AES  
Asymmetric | Identity & key exchange | RSA, ECC  

### 🛰 VPN Encryption
- SSL/TLS VPN (browser-based)
- IPSec VPN (tunnel mode)

### 🧠 Key Stretching
- Strengthens weak passwords
- PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt

### 🎭 Obfuscation
- Makes code harder to interpret
- **Not** encryption

## Summary
Focused on encryption fundamentals and PKI. Learned how public/private keys work, when symmetric vs asymmetric encryption is used, and how VPNs secure communication. Practiced mapping key terms to real examples.
