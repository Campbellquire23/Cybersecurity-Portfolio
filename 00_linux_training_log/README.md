# 🐧 Linux Training Log

Daily hands-on Linux practice completed alongside the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.

## Overview
This section documents 50+ days of command-line work:
- File system navigation (`pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`)
- Redirection & appending (`>`, `>>`)
- Search & parsing (`grep`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `find`)
- Disk & log viewing (`df`, `du`, `head`, `tail -f`)
- (Optional later) Permissions & ownership (`chmod`, `chown`)

Each **DayXX** folder contains:
- the commands practiced
- a short notes.md
- any generated outputs

## Highlights
- Demonstrated consistent daily Linux practice
- Foundation for real-world log forensics & system monitoring
- Directly supports the Log Analysis and Automation projects
