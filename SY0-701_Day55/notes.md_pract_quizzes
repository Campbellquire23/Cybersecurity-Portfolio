Focused on identifying:

Repeated question styles

Common distractor answers

How CompTIA frames scenarios

No handwritten notes were taken today by design.


Key Concepts Reinforced (Recurring Themes)
🔐 Authentication & Access Control

Least Privilege vs Privilege Creep

Privileged Access Management (PAM)
Controls, monitors, and rotates privileged credentials

Credential Stuffing
Uses leaked credentials across multiple services due to password reuse

Federation / SSO / OAuth / OpenID Connect
Authenticate once, access multiple services

🧨 Common Attacks & Threats

Evil Twin (Wireless)
Fake AP with same SSID to intercept traffic

DNS Poisoning / Spoofing
Redirects traffic by corrupting DNS cache

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
Often enabled by ARP/DNS attacks or rogue wireless APs

Privilege Escalation
Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher access rights

Buffer Overflow
Overwriting memory to execute arbitrary code

🧱 Defensive Controls & Security Architecture

SSL/TLS – Encrypts data in transit

PKI & Certificates – Establish trust and identity

WAF – Protects web apps from SQLi, XSS, etc.

NGFW – Deep packet inspection + application awareness

EDR / XDR – Endpoint detection and response

SIEM – Correlates logs and security events

📊 Risk, Compliance & Governance

CVSS – Scores vulnerability severity (0–10)

BIA / RTO / RPO – Business continuity metrics

ISO 27001 / NIST 800-53 – Security frameworks

Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) – Defines allowed behavior

Secure Configuration Guides – Reduce misconfigurations

💾 Data Protection

Full Disk Encryption (FDE) – Protects data at rest

DLP – Prevents data exfiltration

Integrity – Ensures data is not altered

Password Hashing – One-way storage of credentials
