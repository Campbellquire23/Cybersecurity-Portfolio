Overall Day: 57
Practice Exams: Day 13
Focus: Practice quiz review, concept reinforcement, and weak-area identification

🔹 Study Overview

Today was dedicated to completing the majority of the remaining practice quiz sections (30+ sections, 5 questions each). Instead of handwritten notes, the focus was on recognizing recurring concepts, identifying why answers were incorrect, and strengthening exam-style reasoning.

Although many questions were still missed, this session was valuable for exposing gaps and reinforcing how CompTIA phrases and tests key security topics.
