SUMMARY — Risk Analysis, Risk Management Strategies, and Business Impact Analysis
1. Qualitative Risk Assessment

Focuses on subjective evaluation of risk

Uses:

Risk categories (Low / Medium / High)

Color codes (Green / Yellow / Red)

Common factors evaluated:

Impact

Probability

Cost of controls

Overall risk

Useful for:

Quick decision-making

Visual risk comparison

Non-financial prioritization

2. Quantitative Risk Assessment

Uses numeric values and formulas to calculate financial impact.

Key Metrics

Asset Value (AV): Total value of an asset to the organization

Exposure Factor (EF): Percentage of asset lost in an incident

Single Loss Expectancy (SLE):

SLE = AV × EF


Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO):

How often an incident is expected per year

Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE):

ALE = SLE × ARO

Purpose

Determine whether controls are cost-effective

Compare mitigation cost vs expected loss

Support business-level decisions

3. Likelihood vs Probability

Likelihood: Qualitative estimate (high / medium / low)

Probability: Quantitative estimate (numeric likelihood)

Often used interchangeably in discussion, but not the same

4. Risk Appetite vs Risk Tolerance

Risk Appetite:

Overall willingness to accept risk

Broad, strategic definition

Risk Tolerance:

Acceptable deviation from standards

More specific and operational

Example:

Appetite: Willing to accept moderate risk for innovation

Tolerance: Maximum downtime or incident threshold

5. Risk Register

A formal document listing:

Identified risks

Risk owners

Mitigation steps

Status and monitoring results

Every project should have:

A plan

A documented risk register

6. Risk Ownership & Thresholds

Each risk must have an assigned owner

Risk threshold:

Mitigation should occur when cost of mitigation ≤ potential loss

Ensures accountability and cost efficiency

7. Risk Management Strategies

Organizations may choose to:

Accept

Risk is within tolerance

Often documented with exceptions

Transfer

Shift risk to another party

Examples:

Insurance

Outsourcing

Avoid

Stop high-risk activity entirely

Mitigate

Reduce likelihood or impact

Implement security controls

8. Risk Reporting

Formal documentation for senior management

Includes:

Critical risks

Financial exposure

Justification for mitigation or acceptance

Used for:

Budget decisions

Resource allocation

Strategic planning

9. Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
Recovery Metrics

RTO (Recovery Time Objective):

Maximum acceptable downtime

RPO (Recovery Point Objective):

Maximum acceptable data loss

MTTR (Mean Time to Repair):

Average time to restore service

MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures):

Average time between outages

Purpose

Identify critical systems

Prioritize recovery efforts

Estimate operational and financial impact of outages

Support disaster recovery and continuity planning
