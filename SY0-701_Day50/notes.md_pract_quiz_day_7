🧠 Concepts Reviewed & Reinforced
☁️ Cloud & Data Security

CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker)
Acts as an intermediary between users and cloud service providers to enforce security policies. CASBs provide visibility, data protection, authentication, authorization, logging, auditing, and threat detection for cloud resources.

Tokenization
Replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens that have no intrinsic value. Helps prevent data leakage by ensuring original data is only accessible to authorized systems.

SOC 2 Report
An independent assessment of a service provider’s controls based on Trust Services Criteria such as security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. Used to evaluate vendor security posture.

🌍 Authentication, VPNs & Access Controls

Impossible Travel Time
A security policy that detects and blocks logins from geographically impossible locations within an unrealistic time window.

Site-to-Site VPN
Securely connects two or more networks over the internet. Best for linking office locations and supporting multiple users without requiring individual VPN clients.

⚙️ Availability, Redundancy & Reliability

Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
A component whose failure causes the entire system to stop functioning, creating high risk to availability and business continuity.

High Availability (HA) Pair
Two identical systems operating in parallel to provide redundancy and failover, eliminating single points of failure.

🎭 Social Engineering & Human Factors

Whaling
A targeted phishing attack aimed at high-profile individuals such as executives to steal sensitive information or gain privileged access.

Threat Feeds / Threat Intelligence
Sources that provide real-time or near-real-time information about threats, vulnerabilities, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and malicious activity. Used to improve detection and response.

🏢 Device & Endpoint Governance

CYOD (Choose Your Own Device)
Deployment model where employees select from a pre-approved list of devices, balancing user flexibility with organizational security control.

🔐 Physical Security

Lighting and Fences
Physical security countermeasures designed to deter unauthorized access to facilities and protected assets.
