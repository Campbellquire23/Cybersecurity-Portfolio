4.2 – Asset Management
📦 Acquisition / Procurement

Multi-step process for requesting and obtaining hardware/software.

Begins with a purchase request → approvals → vendor selection.

Requires documentation at every stage.

🏷 Assignment / Allocation

Assets tracked by a central system; records who owns/uses each asset.

Classification examples: laptops, desktops, mobile devices, servers, etc.

Helps track lifecycle, usage, and compliance requirements.

🔐 Security Controls

Baseline imaging: consistent OS/security baseline deployed across devices.

RFID/barcodes often used for tracking physical assets.

Mobile devices require:

Password policies

App restrictions

Patch/update automation

Remote wipe capability

MDM management

🧨 Media Sanitization

Protect sensitive data before disposal or reuse.

Methods:

Wiping (overwrite data)

Degaussing (remove magnetic fields)

Physical destruction (shredding, pulverizing)

Often requires a certificate of destruction for compliance.

📜 Data Retention

Determines how long data must be stored for legal or business requirements.

Important for operations, disaster recovery, and compliance.

4.3 – Vulnerability Scanning
🔍 Purpose

Identifies potential weaknesses before attackers can exploit them.

Helps determine if a system may be vulnerable or misconfigured.

🧪 Types of Testing
Static Analysis (SAST)

Reviews source code without running it.

Detects coding flaws, logic errors, and insecure functions.

Dynamic Analysis (DAST)

Tests running applications.

Can identify runtime faults, injection issues, buffer problems, etc.

Fuzzing

Sends unexpected or random input to find crashes, unexpected behavior, or vulnerabilities.

Tools: fuzzing frameworks (BRF, AFL, etc.)

📦 Package Testing & Supply Chain Integrity

Ensure software packages are legitimate and contain no added malware.

Confirm authenticity before deploying.

Test in a sandbox environment first.

Threat Intelligence
🧠 What It Is

Understanding the threats your organization faces.

Helps create better defenses, detection strategies, and response plans.

🌎 Types of Intelligence
OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

Publicly available sources:

Social media

Websites

Forums

Public datasets

Useful for gathering information about potential threats.

Proprietary / Paid Sources

Offered by 3rd-party intelligence services.

More in-depth, high-quality, frequently updated.

Information Sharing Communities

ISACs

Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA)

Provide validated threat data and cross-industry sharing.

Dark Web Intel

Monitors leaked credentials, stolen data, hacking forums.

Requires specialized tools/software to access.

Helps detect early signs of compromise.
