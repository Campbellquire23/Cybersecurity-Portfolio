## 🧱 Video 1.3 (Part 1) — Change Management

### 🔹 Core Concepts
- **Change Approval Process:** A formal method for authorizing and documenting changes to prevent confusion or unauthorized updates.
- **Typical Steps:**
  1. Define the purpose and scope of the change.  
  2. Identify systems, users, or services impacted.  
  3. Schedule and test changes in a sandbox environment before deployment.  
  4. Document and communicate to all stakeholders.  
  5. Implement, verify, and archive results once complete.  

### 🔹 Ownership & Accountability
- Each change needs a responsible owner to manage the process and track approval.  
- Stakeholders should be involved for visibility and control.  

### 🔹 Risk Management
- Determine **risk value** (low, medium, high) for each proposed change.  
- Test thoroughly before implementation — use sandbox or isolated testing.  
- Always create a **rollback plan** in case something goes wrong.  
- For critical changes, schedule during **maintenance windows** or off-hours to reduce impact.

## 🧱 Video 1.3 (Part 2) — Technical Change Management

### 🔹 Documentation & Process
- Change management procedures should be **standardized** and documented.  
- Keep documentation updated — outdated processes cause confusion or noncompliance.  
- All changes should reflect in the **standard operating procedures (SOPs).**

### 🔹 Allow/Deny Lists
- Used to control what software, applications, or activities are permitted or restricted.  
- Example:  
  - **Allow List:** Apps that are approved (e.g., company-issued antivirus).  
  - **Deny List:** Unauthorized or unsafe apps blocked by policy.  

### 🔹 Downtime & Backout Planning
- Changes may cause temporary service unavailability — plan for this.  
- Test secondary systems, apply patches carefully, and switch back if issues occur.  
- Minimize downtime by automating updates when possible.  

### 🔹 Legacy Systems & Dependencies
- Some older systems depend on outdated code or components — upgrading one may affect others.  
- Plan upgrades in sequence (e.g., update firewall firmware *before* security management tools).  
- Keep **version control** to track all config changes and easily revert if needed.

### 🔹 Key Practice Points
- Always test before deploying to production.  
- Document every change, approval, and result.  
- Keep backups and use version control tools for easy rollback.  
- Remember: technical changes are often high risk — communication is critical.
