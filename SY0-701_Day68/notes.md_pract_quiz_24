Day 68 Summary — Practice Quizzes (Day 24)

Focus: Authentication systems, compliance, incident response readiness, application security, and insider threat protection.

Today’s session emphasized enterprise security infrastructure, compliance validation, and response coordination concepts:

Code Integrity & Authenticity:
The best way to ensure compiled binaries in production haven’t been altered is to verify digital signatures and checksums. This confirms both authenticity and integrity of software.

RADIUS Server & AAA:
Installing a RADIUS server enables centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA):

Authentication: Verifies user identity

Authorization: Determines what resources a user can access

Accounting: Tracks user activity for auditing and billing
Used heavily in VPNs, Wi-Fi networks, and enterprise access control.

External Examination (External Audit):
Conducted by an independent third party to assess regulatory compliance, legal obligations, and security posture.
Provides an objective benchmark of how well security policies and controls align with external standards.

Orchestration:
Automated coordination and management of multiple tasks or systems to streamline complex workflows — commonly used in security operations to speed up incident response.

Tabletop Exercises:
Discussion-based simulations used to validate incident response documentation and team readiness without a real attack occurring.
Helps identify gaps in procedures and communication.

Web Application Firewall (WAF):
Protects web applications by monitoring, filtering, and blocking HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
Most appropriate for defending customer-facing portals from SQL injection, XSS, and other web-based attacks.

Insider Threat Awareness:
For organizations with high-value intellectual property, insider threat protection includes:

Employee education on suspicious behavior

Recognizing data exfiltration indicators

Understanding policies for protecting IP

Reporting anomalous activity
Focuses on internal risk rather than external attackers.

End-of-Life (EOL) Systems:
Legacy systems without vendor patch support pose serious security risks.
Lack of updates significantly increases vulnerability exposure.

Defense in Depth:
Layered security approach combining multiple controls (network, application, identity, monitoring) so failure of one layer doesn’t result in total compromise.

Patch Availability & Risk:
Systems without available patches require compensating controls and increased monitoring due to elevated exploit risk.

Incident Response Readiness:
Tabletop exercises are specifically designed to improve the incident response process by practicing roles, escalation paths, and decision-making under simulated conditions.
