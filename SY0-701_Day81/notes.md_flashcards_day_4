Day 81 Summary (Security+ Flashcards – Program Management & Oversight)

Today I completed 20 flashcards focused on Security Program Management and Oversight concepts. The session covered risk management, governance models, compliance, auditing, and incident response planning.

Key Concepts Reviewed
Security Playbooks

Reviewed how playbooks act as step-by-step guides for responding to incidents and ensuring consistent response procedures.

Risk Management Approaches

Risk Avoidance: eliminating risk by not proceeding with an activity.

Qualitative Risk Assessment: subjective evaluation based on judgment and experience.

Quantitative Risk Assessment: uses numerical values and calculations to estimate impact.

Loss Expectancy Formulas

SLE (Single Loss Expectancy) = Asset Value (AV) × Exposure Factor (EF)

ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy) = SLE × Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)

Exposure Factor (EF) represents the percentage of loss expected from a single incident.

Recovery Planning

RTO (Recovery Time Objective): maximum acceptable downtime.

RPO (Recovery Point Objective): maximum acceptable amount of data loss.

Risk Register

Studied how risk registers track identified risks, their likelihood, impact, and planned mitigation responses.

Compliance and Reporting

Reviewed how compliance reporting increases transparency and demonstrates adherence to internal and external security standards.

Compliance Attestation: formal statement verifying compliance requirements are met.

Service Level Agreements (SLA)

SLA defines expected service performance and outlines consequences if performance requirements are not met.

Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

Learned that an MOU outlines expectations between parties but is not legally binding.

Training & Security Awareness

Reviewed phishing simulations as a key training method for improving employee security awareness.

Independent Audits

Covered how external third-party audits verify compliance and strengthen credibility.

Change Management Policies

Studied how change management reduces operational and cybersecurity risk by ensuring changes are documented, reviewed, and controlled.

Incident Response Plan (IRP)

Reviewed how IRPs define steps for managing cybersecurity incidents from detection to lessons learned.

Ad Hoc Assessments

Learned how ad hoc assessments provide rapid evaluation when unexpected risk situations occur.

Governance Models

Centralized governance model: decision-making occurs at the top, ensuring consistent policies across the organization.
