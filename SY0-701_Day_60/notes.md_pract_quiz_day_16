🔐 Security Architecture & Design

Defense in Depth: Layered security approach using multiple controls (technical, administrative, physical) to protect systems from different threat vectors.

Zero Trust Model: Operates on the principle of “never trust, always verify”. Every access request must be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated.

Segmentation: Dividing networks into smaller, isolated segments using firewalls, routers, and switches to limit lateral movement.

Geographic Dispersion: Distributing infrastructure across multiple physical locations to improve resilience and availability.

High Availability & Load Balancing:

Round Robin distributes traffic evenly without considering server state.

Availability zones support fault tolerance and mission-critical workloads.

🌐 Network & Application Security

WAF (Web Application Firewall): Protects web apps from attacks such as SQL injection and XSS by inspecting HTTP/S traffic.

NGFW Application Inspection: Identifies traffic based on application type rather than port number.

SSL/TLS & Certificates:

Certificates are required for decrypting SSL traffic before inspection.

Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) ensures compromised keys cannot decrypt past sessions.

LDAP vs LDAPS:

LDAPS encrypts directory communication using SSL/TLS.

Telnet vs Secure Alternatives:

Telnet transmits credentials in plaintext and should be replaced with SSH.

🧠 Identity, Access, and Privilege Management

Least Privilege: Users are granted only the access necessary to perform their job.

Privilege Creep: Gradual accumulation of access rights over time, increasing attack surface.

PAM (Privileged Access Management):

Controls, monitors, and audits privileged credentials.

Supports credential checkout, session recording, and password rotation.

Federation & SSO:

Allows users to authenticate once and access multiple services using shared identity providers.

MFA: Combines multiple authentication factors (e.g., password + phone call).

☁️ Cloud & Virtualization Security

CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker):

Sits between users and cloud services to enforce security policies.

Detects and categorizes Shadow IT.

VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure):

Centralized desktops hosted in a data center and accessed remotely.

Containers:

Lightweight virtualization providing isolated environments that scale quickly.

IaaS:

Provides virtual machines, networking, and storage managed by a cloud provider.

🛡️ Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities

Password Attacks:

Password Spraying: One common password against many accounts.

Credential Stuffing: Using leaked credentials across multiple services.

Injection Attacks:

SQL injection allows attackers to manipulate backend databases.

CSRF:

Forces authenticated users to perform unwanted actions.

DNS Poisoning/Spoofing:

Corrupts DNS records to redirect users to malicious sites.

Evil Twin Attack:

Fake wireless AP impersonating a legitimate SSID.

Shoulder Surfing:

Physical social-engineering technique.

Shadow IT:

Unauthorized apps or services used without IT approval.

🔍 Monitoring, Detection, and Response

SIEM:

Aggregates and analyzes logs from multiple sources.

SOAR:

Automates incident response workflows and integrates with SIEM.

FPC (Full Packet Capture):

Records full network traffic for forensic analysis.

Honeypots:

Decoy systems designed to attract and monitor attackers.

Sandboxing:

Isolates suspicious files for safe analysis.

Continuous Validation / CI:

Automated testing integrated into development pipelines.

📄 Governance, Risk, and Compliance

NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF):

Categorize → Select → Implement → Assess → Authorize → Monitor.

CVSS:

Standardized vulnerability scoring system (0–10).

ISO 27001:

International standard for information security management systems.

AUP (Acceptable Use Policy):

Defines proper use of organizational IT resources.

Statement of Work (SOW):

Defines project scope, deliverables, and timelines.

Backout / Rollback Plan:

Restores systems to a known-good state if a change fails.

🔐 Data Protection & Privacy

DLP (Data Loss Prevention):

Prevents sensitive data exfiltration via email, file transfer, or cloud storage.

FDE (Full Disk Encryption):

Protects data at rest even if a device is lost or stolen.

Private Data:

Includes medical records, financial data, and PII.

Integrity:

Ensures data has not been altered without authorization.
