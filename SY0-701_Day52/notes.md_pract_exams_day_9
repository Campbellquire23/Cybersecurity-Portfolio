Day 52 – Practice Exams (Day 9) — Summary

Focus: Reviewing missed practice exam questions, reinforcing definitions, and identifying weak domains through repetition.

Key Concepts Reviewed

Authentication & Access Control

Kerberos: Secure network authentication protocol using tickets and a trusted third party; prevents plaintext password transmission.

RADIUS: Centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) commonly used for network access control.

PEAP (Protected EAP): Secure authentication protocol for wireless networks that encapsulates EAP within a TLS tunnel.

Privileged Access Management (PAM): Controls and limits elevated permissions, often using just-in-time access.

Vulnerabilities & Attacks

Privilege Escalation: Exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher access rights than originally authorized.

Buffer Overflow: Occurs when excess data overwrites memory locations, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.

Directory Traversal: Accessing files outside the intended directory using paths like ../.

On-Path (Man-in-the-Middle) Attack: Intercepting or altering communications between two parties.

Brute Force Attack: Repeated login attempts using many password combinations.

Logic Bomb: Malicious code that executes when specific conditions are met.

Network & Infrastructure Security

Containers: Lightweight virtualization running isolated applications on a shared host OS.

Load Balancing: Distributes traffic across multiple systems to improve availability and fault tolerance.

High Availability (HA): Reduces downtime by eliminating single points of failure.

UPS: Provides temporary power and enables graceful shutdowns during outages.

Jump Server (Bastion Host): Controlled intermediary system used to access internal resources securely.

Cryptography & Certificates

PKI Certificates: Used to verify identity and secure communications (e.g., HTTPS).

Certificate Validity Period: Time window when a certificate is trusted.

Wildcard Certificates: Secure multiple subdomains under one domain.

SSL/TLS: Encrypts data in transit between clients and servers.

Monitoring, Detection & Response

SIEM: Aggregates logs and detects threats using correlation and intelligence feeds.

IDS vs IPS: IDS detects suspicious activity; IPS actively blocks it.

NIST 800-53: Framework defining security and privacy controls for federal systems.

SOC 2 Report: Independent assessment of a vendor’s security controls.

Incident Response Team (CSIRT): Handles detection, containment, eradication, and recovery of incidents.

Cloud & Data Protection

CASB: Enforces security policies between users and cloud providers.

DLP: Prevents unauthorized data exfiltration.

Tokenization: Replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens.

Sandboxing: Isolates applications to limit potential damage.
