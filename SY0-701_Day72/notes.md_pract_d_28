✅ Day 72 – Cybersecurity Study Notes

Focus Areas: Data protection, governance, vulnerability scoring, cloud automation, fraud, operational controls, and regulatory compliance.

Data Privacy & Protection
Data Subject

The individual whose personal data is collected, processed, or stored.

Organizations act as custodians responsible for protecting this data.

Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

DLP tools detect and prevent unauthorized transmission of sensitive information using:

Fingerprinting

File signatures

Pattern recognition

Policy enforcement

Purpose: Stop data exfiltration before it occurs.

Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

Defines rules and expectations for using organizational IT resources.

Serves as a managerial control guiding employee behavior.

👉 Helps reduce insider threats and misuse.

Managerial Controls

High-level plans and governance structures that form the foundation of an organization's security program.

They:

Define roles and responsibilities

Establish accountability

Support compliance requirements

Critical Data

Information essential for immediate operations and organizational survival.

Examples include:

Financial records

Operational systems

Intellectual property

Loss of critical data can cause:

Severe financial damage

Reputational harm

Operational disruption

Potential business failure

CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

Provides a standardized method for rating vulnerability severity.

Generates a numerical score (0–10)

Reflects exploitability and potential impact.

Used for:

Prioritizing patching

Risk management decisions

Resource allocation

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

A cloud best practice that allows infrastructure to be provisioned using machine-readable configuration files such as:

YAML

JSON

Benefits:

Faster deployments

Version control

Consistency

Scalability

Reduced manual error

Business Email Compromise (BEC) – Invoice Scam

A fraud technique where attackers send fake invoices hoping an employee processes payment without proper verification.

Primary weakness exploited: Lack of payment validation controls.

Security Automation

Automation is the most reliable way to maintain consistent security enforcement.

Helps organizations:

Reduce human error

Improve detection

Enforce policies continuously

Especially valuable as environments scale.

Job Rotation (Detective Control)

Moving employees between roles periodically.

Benefits:

Exposes fraudulent activity

Identifies process weaknesses

Provides fresh oversight

Acts as a detective control

Regulatory Audits in Banking

Financial institutions operate under strict regulatory frameworks such as:

Basel Accords

Dodd-Frank

GLBA

SOX

Audits ensure:

Financial integrity

Transparency

Regulatory compliance

🔥 Key Takeaways From Today

If you remember nothing else, remember these:

✅ Protect sensitive data with layered controls
✅ Prioritize vulnerabilities using CVSS
✅ Automate security whenever possible
✅ Governance drives security maturity
✅ Fraud often exploits human process failures
✅ Critical data = organizational survival
