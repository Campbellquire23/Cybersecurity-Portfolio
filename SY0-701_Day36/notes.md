Day 36 Summary — Change Management, Governance, and Security Standards
1. Change Management & Security Procedures
Purpose of Change Management

Prevent:

Confusion

Mistakes

Unauthorized changes

Security gaps created by poorly documented updates

Provide:

A structured path for approving, tracking, and reviewing changes

Accountability for who changed what, when, and why

Onboarding & Offboarding Processes

Onboarding:

Grant access based on job role (Role-Based Access Control)

Create necessary accounts

Assign permissions, MFA, and required tools

Offboarding:

Must be planned to prevent:

Former employees accessing systems

Data leakage

Includes:

Disabling accounts

Reclaiming devices

Resetting passwords

Reviewing access logs

2. Playbooks & Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

Give IT/security teams step-by-step instructions

Include:

Checklists

Required documentation

Escalation steps

Testing + verification steps

Help prevent:

Mistakes

Inconsistent responses

Delays

Examples of What Playbooks Cover

Password resets

User privilege changes

Incident response escalation

System updates

Network configuration changes

Change Control

Changes should be:

Approved

Documented

Tested

Scheduled

Reviewed after implementation

3. Governance Structures

Governance Board: Makes decisions, approves changes, sets policies.

Involves:

Subject matter experts

Compliance officers

Technical staff

Resolves:

Conflicts

Policy issues

Disagreements between teams

Governance Types
Centralized Governance

One central authority approves and manages all processes.

Consistent, controlled.

Decentralized Governance

Decision-making spread across different teams/locations.

More flexible, but harder to control.

4. Security Standards (ISO, NIST, Industry Standards)
ISO & NIST

Define global security standards used by:

Governments

Corporations

IT departments

Security teams

Password Requirements

Standards can define:

Complexity rules

Rotation policies

MFA usage

Lockout thresholds

Authentication Policies

Determine:

Allowed login methods

LDAP / Active Directory requirements

SSO requirements

MFA enforcement

5. Access Control Policies

Define:

Who has access

When access is allowed

Under what conditions

Includes:

Mandatory Access Control

Role-Based Access Control

Privileged Access Management

Documentation must show:

Access justification

Approvals

Time of assignment

Access Removal

Must be:

Timely

Documented

Verified

6. Physical Security Standards

Policies cover:

Badges

Biometrics

Visitor management

Door locks & access control

Alarm and surveillance systems

Physical System Requirements

Electronic locks

Sensors and alarms

Camera monitoring

Access log retention

7. Cryptographic Standards

Standards must specify:

Encryption algorithm types

Key storage procedures

Password storage hash requirements

Acceptable cryptographic modules

Encryption applies differently to:

Data in use

Data in transit

Data at rest
