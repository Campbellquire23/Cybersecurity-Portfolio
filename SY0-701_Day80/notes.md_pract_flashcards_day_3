Day 80 – CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) Flashcards Practice – Security Operations

Today I completed Day 3 of flashcard practice, focusing on Security Operations concepts. I reviewed approximately 20 flashcards and wrote down definitions and key takeaways to reinforce recall-based learning.

Key Topics Reviewed

OSINT (Open Source Intelligence): Gathering threat intelligence from publicly available sources.

Dark Web: A hidden part of the internet often associated with criminal marketplaces and threat actor activity.

False Negatives: When a system fails to detect a real threat and incorrectly reports no issue.

MFA Factors: Authentication methods based on something you know, have, or are.

DLP (Data Loss Prevention): Tools and policies used to prevent unauthorized sharing or leakage of sensitive data.

Input Validation: Used to reduce risks like injection attacks and XSS by filtering and sanitizing user input.

COPE (Corporate-Owned Personally Enabled): Company-managed devices that allow limited personal use.

Signature-Based Detection: Detecting threats using known patterns or malicious signatures.

Data Sanitization: Permanently destroying or wiping data so it cannot be recovered.

Network Logs: Monitoring traffic and device activity through routers, switches, and packet captures.

MDM (Mobile Device Management): Managing and enforcing security policies on mobile devices.

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management): Aggregating logs and alerts into a centralized monitoring system.

Tabletop Exercises: Simulated security incident scenarios used to test response planning.

Data Retention Policies: Defines how long data must be stored based on legal/compliance needs.

Static Code Analysis: Reviewing source code for vulnerabilities without running the program.

WPA3: Wireless security improvement using SAE authentication to resist brute-force attacks.

Defense in Depth: Layered security approach to reduce the impact of threats.

Switch Hardening: Reducing attack surface by disabling unused ports, applying security configs, and monitoring activity.

Sandboxing: Running applications in isolated environments to prevent system-wide compromise.

Reflection

Flashcards required deeper recall compared to quizzes, but they highlighted areas where definitions and terminology need reinforcement. This practice strengthens long-term memory and supports exam readiness.
