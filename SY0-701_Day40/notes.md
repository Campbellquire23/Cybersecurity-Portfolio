DAY 40 SUMMARY — Third-Party Risk Assessment & Vendor Management
1. Third-Party Risk Overview

Most organizations rely on vendors, suppliers, and service providers

Third-party risk occurs when:

A vendor has access to systems, data, or facilities

Weak vendor security becomes your organization’s risk

Risk assessment does not stop when a contract is signed

Validate vendor security controls

Meet compliance and regulatory requirements

Often required:

Before onboarding a vendor

During contract renewals

Periodically throughout the relationship

May include:

Vulnerability assessments

Penetration testing (simulated attacks)

Compliance reviews

3. Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)

Simulates real-world attacks

Similar to vulnerability scans but:

Actively attempts exploitation

Often:

Performed by independent third parties

Required by compliance frameworks

Results help identify:
