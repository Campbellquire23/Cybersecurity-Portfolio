📘 CompTIA Security+ – Day 58 Summary

Overall Day: 58
Practice Exams: Day 14
Milestone: Completed full 38-section practice quiz set

🔹 Study Overview

Today marked the completion of a 38-section Security+ practice quiz set that has been worked through over the past two weeks. The focus today was not heavy note-taking, but final reinforcement of recurring concepts, reviewing mistakes, and recognizing patterns in CompTIA-style questions.

This session emphasized risk reduction strategies, data protection controls, and network-level security restrictions, all of which continue to appear frequently across practice exams.

🔐 Key Concepts Reinforced

Data Protection & Monitoring

Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Preventing unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive data via email, file transfer, or cloud storage through monitoring and policy enforcement.

Detection and blocking of attempts to move sensitive data outside the organization.

Infrastructure & Power Controls

Managed Power Distribution Units (PDUs): Used to monitor and control power consumption in secure environments, helping identify abnormal power usage that could indicate unauthorized devices.

Network Access Restrictions

Limiting exposure of systems with expired vendor support or known vulnerabilities.

Use of:

Firewalls

Network segmentation

VLANs

Access control lists (ACLs)

Reducing attack surface and mitigating risk from legacy or unpatchable systems.

Risk Mitigation Strategy

Using compensating and preventative controls to reduce the impact of vulnerabilities when systems cannot be immediately replaced.

Applying layered defenses to control access rather than relying on a single security mechanism.

🧠 Key Takeaways

Completing the full quiz set revealed consistent weak domains, which is expected at this stage.

Many incorrect answers are tied to:

Subtle wording differences

Choosing “best” vs “technically correct” answers

Exposure across all 38 sections has improved:

Threat recognition

Control classification (preventive vs detective vs corrective)

Confidence in eliminating wrong answer choices

🎯 Next Steps

Begin new practice quiz sets with a fresh baseline

Shift focus from volume to:

Domain-based review

High-frequency exam topics

Continue documenting progress daily to track improvement and persistence
